Dataset :- COVID-19 Radiography Database from Kaggle 

Predicted whether the Chest X-Ray is of a Covid patient or a viral fever patient or a normal person with 98.89 percent accuracy.
Used ResNet-18 pretrained model with Data Augmentation using batch gradient descent (batch size=6).
Deep Learning Framework used is Pytorch.
