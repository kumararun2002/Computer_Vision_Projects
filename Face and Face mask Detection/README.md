Developed a model to identify human faces from a given image and predict whether they are wearing face masks or not.
Used pre-trained weights of a Caffe Model and OpenCV to detect human faces in an image and trained a 5-layered Convolutional Neural Net using Pytorch Lightning to predict whether the person is wearing a face mask or not.
Trained model on COVID Face Mask detection Dataset (Kaggle).
